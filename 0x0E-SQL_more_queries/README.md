SQL - Additional Queries
In this project, I focused on enhancing my SQL skills by practicing various queries, including permissions, joins, and constraints.

Usage üê¨
The script 3-force_name.sql requires the database to query from as a MySQL command line argument:

bash

Copy
$ cat 3-force_name.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p hbtn_0d_2
Tasks 3-101 query from the database defined in hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql, while tasks 102-103 query from hbtn_0d_tvshows_rate.sql.
