# SQL Project - Introduction

This project marks my initial venture into the world of SQL and relational databases. Throughout this journey, I practiced key concepts in data definition and data manipulation languages, crafted subqueries, and utilized various functions to interact with the database.

## Usage üê¨

The scripts provided in this project are designed to be executed in a MySQL environment. For instance, the script `3-list_tables.sql` can be run from the command line, taking the target database as an argument:

```bash
$ cat 3-list_tables.sql | mysql -h localhost -u root -p mysql
